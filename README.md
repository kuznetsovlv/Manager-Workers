# Manager & Workers project

Threading exercise

## Description:
There are one manager and some workers. The manager drives self working and workers' working. Now relised two behaviors:
- Option 1: Each of workers performs it's work once and the manager permors it's work last. Then loop repeats. Workers works in random order but manager works always last in each loop.
- Option 2: One and only one random worker performs it's work for workers' amount times, then the manager works once and loop repeats with any random worker.

In both cases the program works about 1 second.
